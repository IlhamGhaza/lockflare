```

- **lib/config/localization/**: Houses GetX translation maps and the `LanguageController`, enabling runtime language switching and persistence.

- **lib/config/theme/**: Contains GetX theme configuration, including `theme_controller.dart` for reactive theme management and `theme.dart` for Material theme data.

- **lib/data/**: Houses the implementations of various cryptographic algorithms, each encapsulated in its respective Dart file, facilitating easy maintenance and scalability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that the following tools are installed on your system:

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Dart SDK
- An integrated development environment (IDE) such as Android Studio or Visual Studio Code with Flutter extensions

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IlhamGhaza/LockFlare.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd LockFlare
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

Upon launching the application, users can navigate through different sections, each dedicated to a specific cryptographic algorithm. Interactive interfaces allow users to input data, apply encryption techniques, and observe the results, thereby enhancing their understanding of cryptographic processes.

### Theme & Localization

- Toggle between light and dark themes via the profile page. The preference is persisted using GetStorage.
- Switch between English (`en`) and Indonesian (`id`) at runtime using the language selector on the profile page. All texts use GetX `.tr` keys, ensuring instant localization.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the application's functionality or to introduce new cryptographic algorithms are welcome. To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Implement your changes and ensure they are well-documented.
4. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your modifications.
